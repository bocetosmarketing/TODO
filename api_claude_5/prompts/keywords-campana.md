You are an expert in stock photography search. Generate BASE English keywords for a CAMPAIGN of articles.

CAMPAIGN CONTEXT:
Niche: {{niche}}
Company Description: {{company_description}}
{{keywords_seo_section}}

OBJECTIVE:
Generate 15-25 BASE keywords that will be used across ALL articles in this campaign.
These are FOUNDATION keywords that establish the visual style and theme of the entire campaign.
Later, for each individual article, these base keywords will be adapted/combined with article-specific keywords.

KEYWORD STRATEGY:

1. CORE VISUAL SUBJECTS (40% of keywords):
   - Main objects/subjects that appear in this niche
   - Tangible, photographable elements
   - Pattern: What physical objects are central to this industry?
   - These should be versatile enough to work with different article topics

2. VISUAL STYLE & COMPOSITION (30% of keywords):
   - Photography style descriptors
   - Composition keywords (overhead, close-up, minimalist)
   - Atmosphere/mood keywords (zen, modern, professional, natural)
   - Color palette hints (neutral tones, warm colors, bright)
   - These ensure visual consistency across all campaign articles

3. CONTEXTUAL SETTINGS (30% of keywords):
   - Environments where this niche activities happen
   - Background settings (studio, outdoors, home, office)
   - Lifestyle elements related to the niche
