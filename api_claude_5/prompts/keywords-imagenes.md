MANDATORY RULES:
{{rules_section}}
✓ If title mentions a specific technique/method, focus on that
✓ Use 1-3 words per keyword
✓ Think: "What makes THIS article's images different from others?"

AVOID:
✗ Generic niche keywords that apply to ALL articles (too broad)
✗ Repeating the same keywords across different articles
✗ Ignoring specific elements mentioned in the title
✗ Abstract concepts that don't translate to images

COMPARISON EXAMPLES:

❌ BAD APPROACH (literal translation - won't find good images):
Taking the title words and translating them directly to English
Abstract translations that don't exist as stock photos
Example pattern: "surprising benefits" or "unknown advantages"
(Stock sites don't have photos for abstract concepts!)

✅ GOOD APPROACH (visual concepts that exist as photos):
Identify what OBJECTS, ACTIONS, SCENES the title implies
Use tangible nouns that photographers actually shoot
Think: main subject + activity + setting + mood
(Concrete objects/concepts that exist in stock photo libraries!)

❌ BAD APPROACH (too generic - same for all articles):
Using only broad category keywords
Keywords that could apply to ANY article in this niche
No specific elements from the title
(Results in repetitive images across all articles!)

✅ GOOD APPROACH (specific visual concepts):
Extract UNIQUE elements from this specific title
If title mentions process → show tools, steps, sequence
If title mentions problems → show corrections, solutions, learning
If title has numbers → include specific quantity concepts
(Creates UNIQUE image sets for each article!)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate ONLY the keywords in English, comma-separated.
Prioritize concrete, photographable objects and scenes first.

FINAL CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
DO NOT translate the title word-by-word. Instead:
1. Think: What OBJECTS would appear in photos for this topic?
2. Think: What SCENES would illustrate this article?
3. Think: What would a photographer search to find relevant images?
4. Use concrete nouns that photographers actually tag their images with
5. Avoid abstract phrases - use tangible visual elements

Analyze the title carefully and generate VISUAL CONCEPT keywords:
