BASIC INSTRUCTIONS: {{title_prompt}}

COMPANY DESCRIPTION:
{{company_description}}

SEO KEYWORDS:
{{keywords_seo}}

TASK:
Before generating the title, identify the thematic ecosystem of this business:

STEP 1 - ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS:
Identify the main activity and EXPAND to specific adjacent topics:

Focus on DERIVED TOPICS, not services:
- Specific products/varieties that exist in this sector (NOT the company's services)
- Raw materials, ingredients, or components used in this industry
- Techniques, methods or processes common in this field
- Geographic origins or cultural traditions linked to these products
- Current trends in this sector
- Health, wellness or benefits associated with these products/practices
- History, evolution or curiosities of specific elements
- Practical tips or guides for end users
- Events, rituals or experiences around these products
- Experts, personalities or cultural references
- Comparisons, differences or nuances within specific product categories

CRITICAL: Think like this:
- Tea company → matcha, green tea, processes, Japanese ceremonies, health benefits of specific teas
- Clothing store → sustainable fabrics, color psychology in fashion, vintage styles, care techniques for specific materials
- Hair salon → keratin treatments, balayage techniques, hair care ingredients, styling for specific hair types

DO NOT think about the company's services. Think about the THINGS, PRODUCTS, TECHNIQUES, or TRENDS that exist in this world.

STEP 2 - TITLE GENERATION:
Generate 1 journalistic title that:

CONTENT:
- Addresses ONE specific and concrete topic from the ecosystem (NOT the company)
- Mentions tangible elements: varieties, origins, techniques, styles, materials, specific processes
- Integrates at least 1 SEO keyword organically
- Provides real informative, cultural or practical value
- Could be published in a specialized magazine about this sector

STYLE:
- Journalistic and accessible
- 60-80 characters
- No sensationalism
- Credible and verifiable
- Think Vogue, Bon Appétit, Architectural Digest tone (depending on sector)

FORBIDDEN:
- Talking about the company or its services directly
- Generic titles that could apply to any sector
- Vague formulas like "The world of...", "Everything about..."
- Clickbait or commercial titles
- Titles about "experiences", "workshops", "courses" or other service-oriented language

OUTPUT:
Return only the title in SPANISH, without explanations.
